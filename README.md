Challenge 1  Collatz Conjecture
Loop used: while loop Why: Because we don’t know how many steps it’ll take to reach 1. The loop keeps going until the number becomes 1

How it works
User enters a starting number.
If the number is even, divide it by 2.
If it’s odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
Keep printing each number until we hit 1.
Count how many steps it took.
thats it

Challenge 2 Prime Number Checker
Loop used while loop Why: We need to check every number from 2 up to the number the user entered. A while loop lets us stop early if we find a divisor.
How it works 
User enters a number.
We test if it’s divisible by anything from 2 to (number - 1).
If it is, it’s not prime.
If it’s not divisible by anything, it is prime.
Challenge 3: Multiplication Table
Loop used: for loop (nested) Why: We know the range (1 to 10), so for loops are perfect. One loop for rows, one for columns.

How it works:
First, pint the header row (1 to 10).
Then for each row, print the row number and all the products.
Use spacing to line everything up nicely.
